## Hola 👋 Hi there! 

I am a **researcher** and **community builder** working with scientific communities, and a recovering molecular biologist previously researching genomics and chronic pain physiology.

I am particularly interested in bringing open science and management skills to every researcher, so we can work more efficiently and make science more equitable. 
I thrive in open communities and love to work in anything related to improving collaboration within the research world 🧬🗺️

A bit about me: 

🌱 I’m currently the **Community and Training lead** at [OLS](https://we-are-ols.org/), where we work building capacity in Open Science and promoting diverse and open leadership.

🔭 I am part of the **Research Community Management** teams of different organisations like [The Turing Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/) (as the co-chair of teh community management working group) and [Data Science for Health Equity](https://www.datascienceforhealthequity.com/) (as part of the CM team). 

👯 Core team member of [RCM Cooperative](https://www.rcmcooperative.com/) where we work towards building sustainable reseearch communities, developing training for Research Community Managers and acting as a network within CM. 

💬 If you have ideas about anything open and/or collaborative, I'd love to have a chat!
